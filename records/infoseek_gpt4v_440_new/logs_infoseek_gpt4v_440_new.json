Wheat is one of the oldest and most important of the cereal crops, and it was originally cultivated in the regions of the Near East known as the Fertile Crescent. This region includes parts of modern-day countries like Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, and Jordan, among others. Domesticated wheat likely originated in southeastern Turkey and was cultivated as early as 9600 BCE.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1714694079, model='gpt-4-1106-vision-preview', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=108, prompt_tokens=462, total_tokens=570))"
