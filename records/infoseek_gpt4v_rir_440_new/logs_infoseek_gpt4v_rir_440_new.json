They are typically distributed along coastlines and inland waterways.\\n\\nWhile the term \"endemic\" refers to species that are native to a particular geographic area and found nowhere else, this is not the case for the Caspian Tern, as it has a large range spanning many continents and is not restricted to a unique region or ecosystem.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1714696647, model='gpt-4-1106-vision-preview', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=165, prompt_tokens=2165, total_tokens=2330))"
