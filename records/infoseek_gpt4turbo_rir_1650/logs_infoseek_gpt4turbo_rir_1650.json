Specifically, the term \"magnetars\" indicates that the image may be related to these exotic astronomical objects.\\n\\nMagnetars, a type of neutron star characterized by extremely powerful magnetic fields, were first proposed as a concept in 1992 by Robert Duncan and Christopher Thompson. This proposal was based on the study of anomalous x-ray pulsars. Therefore, if the image indeed depicts a magnetar, it would be linked to discoveries and work that began in the early 1990s.\\n\\nSo, related to the discovery, we can say that the concept of magnetars was introduced in the year 1992.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1714716360, model='gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_5d12056990', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=157, prompt_tokens=1657, total_tokens=1814))"

For instance, in the Czechoslovak military, it was succeeded by newer models like the ZB vz. 30 and later by Soviet-designed guns after the 1948 communist coup in Czechoslovakia. Since the firearm's retirement period could vary widely depending on the country and specific military or paramilitary use, a specific global retirement year is hard to pinpoint.
