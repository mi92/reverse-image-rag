# Reverse Image RAG - (RIR)

### Synopsis: 
We build an API to retrieval-augment vision-language models with visual context retrieved from the web.

Concretely, for a query image and query text (e.g. a question), we leverage reverse image search to find most similar images and their titles / captions.

The final product is a VLM-API that allows to automatically leverage reverse-image-search based retrieval augmentation.  


### Usage:  

```pip install rir_api```

```python
import rir_api 

api = rir_api.RIR_API(openai_api_key)

image_url = "https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSgN8RDkURVE8mgOf-n02TqJdC2l1o5cVFA32NpZtuVp8MaFfZY"
query_text = "What is in this image?"
response = api.query_with_image(image_url, query_text)
# >> runs reverse image search
# >> formats visual context prompt
# >> queries VLM with full query
```

(see run.py for minimal example)
