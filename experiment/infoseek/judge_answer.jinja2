Question: What is the closest parent taxonomy of this plant?

Gold Answer: ["Sanicula"]

Other Acceptable Answers: ["Sanicula"]

Model Answer: "The image shows a green herbaceous plant, with compound leaves that are somewhat lobed or dissected, and small clustered inflorescences. The plant appears to be a member of the Apiaceae family (formerly known as the Umbelliferae), which is characterized by umbrella-like inflorescences called umbels, and often aromatic plants. Common examples from this family include parsley, dill, celery, and carrot. Without a more detailed examination or additional context, it is not possible to provide the exact species, but Apiaceae would be the closest parent family taxonomy based on the visible characteristics."
