In the cases where the query ask for a quantity and your estimate is a range, provide in addition your best estimate for the mean. 
Example 1: if the query is 'What is the typical tail length of the animal shown in the image?', and you have '12 to 20 cm', add an addtional 'AVERAGE: 16 cm' to the end of your response. 
Example 2: if the query is 'What is the typical litter size of the animal shown in the image?', and you have '3 to 6', add an addtional 'AVERAGE: 4.5' to the end of your response. 
If the query asks for a quantity but you cannot come up with such answers, add an additional 'AVERAGE: unknown' to the end of your response.
